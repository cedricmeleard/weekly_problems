["From Interview question of the week and week question is:"](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/youve-got-to-get-up-every-morning-with-a-smile-on/)

> Given a list, swap every two adjacent nodes. Something to think about: How would your code change if this were a linked list, versus an array?

```javascript
> swapPairs([1,2,3,4])
> [2,1,4,3]

> swapPairs([])
> []
```

> Given an integer n, count the total number of 1 digits appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Example:

```javascript
> numberOfOnes(14)
> 7 // 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
```
